Wheeler also said the presence of federal law enforcement in Portland was exacerbating the situation.\n\nWheeler said Friday, “Keep your troops in your own buildings, or have them leave our city.”","tags":["TEN","NEWS","AM","TEST"],"deliveryDesc":"“The words and actions from President Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have shown that this is an attack on our democracy,” Wheeler added.\n\nSpeaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Wheeler doubled down on his statements.\n\n“The president has a complete misunderstanding of cause and effect,” Wheeler said. “What's happening here is we have dozens, if not hundreds of federal troops descending upon our city and what they're doing is they are sharply escalating the situation. Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism.”","isNew":false,"ownerId":"15952412505626","id":"1595241250562624","createTime":1595298945328,"pics":["/files/kisichun@gmail.com/1594700096603.png","/files/kisichun@gmail.com/1594700096603.png","/files/kisichun@gmail.com/1594700096603.png","/files/kisichun@gmail.com/1594700096603.png","/files/kisichun@gmail.com/1594700096603.png"],"like":0,"postStatus":true}
